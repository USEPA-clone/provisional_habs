<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository houses provisional water quality monitoring datasets collected 
from two ponds in Barnstable, MA.  These data are collected to help track, 
understand and eventually forecast potential Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).  We
use several data sources for this effort which include: data buoys, an on-board,
flow-through system, aka FLAMe, and water samples that are processed in a lab
for various measurements.  The data from these sources are provided here as 
provisional data and they may change.

# Data Access

The provisional data are provided as comma delimited files and are suitable for 
use with spreadsheets or easily read into many common programming languages 
(e.g. R, python, etc.).  The easiest way to download files is right click on the 
links below and select "Save link as...".
