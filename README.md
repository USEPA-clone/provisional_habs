This repository houses provisional water quality monitoring datasets collected 
from two ponds in Barnstable, MA.  These data are collected to help track, 
understand and eventually forecast potential Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).  We
use several data sources for this effort which include: data buoys, an on-board,
flow-through system, aka FLAMe, and water samples that are processed in a lab
for various measurements.  The data from these sources are provided here as 
provisional data.  These data may change at any moment due to any number of 
possible data quality issues.
